Subject: Application for Senior Software Engineer – AI at Shapes, Inc.

Dear Shapes Team,

I am excited to apply for the Senior Software Engineer – AI role at Shapes, Inc. Over the past year, I have created and maintained 128 AI agents (“Shapes”), supporting 31,000+ conversations while designing structured prompts, memory systems, and orchestration flows that reflect your vision of agents that feel like companions rather than calculators.

My work includes building the Shapes CLI, a Python-based tool with model routing, audio I/O, and replayable session logs, as well as experimenting with interfaces inspired by the Shapes Learning Hub and Shape API to extend agent customization and conversational persistence. These projects gave me practical experience in prompt engineering, evaluation harnesses, and RAG-style architectures, aligning directly with your need for fine-tuning pipelines, ingestion systems, and evaluation frameworks.

I bring a combination of hands-on systems experience and academic foundation: U.S. Air Force veteran, B.S. in Computer Science (Software Engineering Concentration, GPA 3.77), and strong backend and DevOps experience (FastAPI, Node/Express, AWS Lambda, Docker, PostgreSQL, Redis). To further strengthen my expertise, I am beginning a Master’s in Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence concentration) at Southern New Hampshire University on November 10, 2025.

My resume, project portfolio, and tailored cover letters can be found here:

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to contributing to Shapes’ mission and helping build the infrastructure and interfaces that power the next generation of Shape creation, customization, and multi-user interactions.

Sincerely,
Christian J. Busca
