# Cover Letter — Senior Software Engineer (Frontend)

Dear Shapes Team,

I am applying for the Senior Software Engineer – Frontend role at Shapes, Inc. My passion lies in creating interfaces that make AI feel alive and approachable, and my projects reflect that. I’ve built a variety of **frontends for AI and embedded systems**, including visualization tools for agents, replayable logs, and LCD-driven interfaces on Raspberry Pi.

My **Shapes CLI** project explored not only backend orchestration but also how users experience AI through design. I emphasized **micro-interactions, structured outputs, and replay features** that make conversations feel consistent and trustworthy. In addition, I developed full-stack apps with **Angular, React, Tailwind, and shadcn/ui**, and implemented accessible UI components for cloud-hosted apps using AWS.

I believe strongly in Shapes’ vision of building **the interface through which humanity will experience AGI**, and I bring a combination of **frontend craft (React, Next.js, Angular)** and **AI experimentation** that positions me well to design intuitive tools for creating, managing, and visualizing Shapes.

I would be honored to contribute to your mission by helping design frontends that feel as natural as friendships.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,  
**Christian J. Busca**
