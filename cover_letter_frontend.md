# Cover Letter — Senior Software Engineer (Frontend)

Dear Shapes Team,

I am applying for the Senior Software Engineer – Frontend role at Shapes, Inc. I craft conversation-first interfaces that make AI feel approachable and consistent. My projects emphasize micro-interactions, structured outputs, and replay features that build trust—principles reflected in the Shapes Learning Hub and the Shape creation flow.

I’ve built frontends with React/Angular/Tailwind/shadcn, and I pair UI polish with data/agent concerns (prompt contracts, memory, evaluation logs). I’ve also shipped a cloud app (AWS Lambda + Angular/Node) and hardware-driven interfaces (Raspberry Pi LCD): varied contexts, same priority on clarity and feedback.

I value ownership and precise execution, and I’m beginning an M.S. in Computer Science (AI concentration) at SNHU on November 10, 2025. I’d love to help design the tools that creators will use to build, customize, and visualize their Shapes.

Sincerely,
Christian J. Busca
