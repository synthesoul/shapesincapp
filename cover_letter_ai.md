# Cover Letter — Senior Software Engineer (AI)

Dear Shapes Team,

I am excited to apply for the Senior Software Engineer – AI role at Shapes, Inc. Over the past year, I have created and maintained 128 AI agents (“Shapes”), supporting 31,000+ conversations while designing structured prompts, memory systems, and orchestration flows that reflect your vision of agents that feel like companions rather than calculators.

My work includes building the Shapes CLI, a Python-based tool with model routing, audio I/O, and replayable session logs, and developing interfaces influenced by the Shapes Learning Hub and the Shape API to improve customization and conversational persistence. These projects gave me practical experience in prompt engineering, model evaluation harnesses, and RAG-style architectures, aligning with your needs for fine-tuning pipelines, data ingestion, and rigorous evaluation frameworks.

I bring hands-on systems experience and an academic foundation: U.S. Air Force veteran, B.S. in Computer Science (Software Engineering Concentration, GPA 3.77), and strong backend/DevOps experience (FastAPI, Node/Express, AWS Lambda, Docker, PostgreSQL, Redis). To deepen my expertise, I begin an M.S. in Computer Science (AI concentration) at SNHU on November 10, 2025.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to contributing to the AI stack that supports large-scale, multi-user Shape interactions.

Sincerely,
Christian J. Busca
