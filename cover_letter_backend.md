# Cover Letter — Senior Software Engineer (Backend)

Dear Shapes Team,

I am applying for the Senior Software Engineer – Backend role at Shapes, Inc. My background spans network engineering (U.S. Air Force; WireKor LLC) and building agent ecosystems with logging, replay, and persona contracts—experience that maps well to real-time, event-driven backends.

For my Shapes CLI project, I designed backend flows handling 128+ agents and 31K+ messages across multiple contexts. I built low-latency, replayable logs; structured persona contracts; and reliability features suited to multi-user systems. I’ve also delivered a serverless full-stack app (AWS Lambda, API Gateway, S3/CloudFront, Angular/Node) and embedded Pi projects with state machines—evidence of sound systems thinking.

I work daily with Python/Node, REST/WebSockets, Redis, Mongo/Postgres, and Docker. I focus on scalability and latency, and I’m comfortable owning systems end-to-end. I’m also beginning an M.S. in Computer Science (AI concentration) at SNHU on November 10, 2025.

I’m excited to help architect and optimize the distributed infrastructure that powers Shape memory, knowledge, and real-time interactions at scale.

Sincerely,
Christian J. Busca
