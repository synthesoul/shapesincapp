# Cover Letter — Senior Software Engineer (Backend)

Dear Shapes Team,

I am writing to apply for the Senior Software Engineer – Backend role at Shapes, Inc. With experience designing network infrastructure in the U.S. Air Force and at WireKor LLC, as well as building AI ecosystems from scratch, I bring a strong background in **distributed systems, API design, and real-time interactions**.

For my **Shapes CLI** project, I architected backend flows to manage **128+ agents** with strict persona contracts and replayable logs, handling **31K+ messages** across multiple contexts. I also developed **state-machine-driven systems** on Raspberry Pi (Python, GPIO, I²C LCD) and a **serverless full-stack app** (AWS Lambda, API Gateway, S3, Angular, Node) that demonstrate my ability to design reliable, event-driven architectures.

My technical skills align with your stack: **Python, Node.js, REST/WebSockets, Redis, MongoDB, and Docker**. I have practical experience in optimizing **latency-sensitive systems** and ensuring stability in multi-user contexts, and I thrive in environments where ownership and scalability matter most.

I am enthusiastic about Shapes’ mission of making AI agents socially indispensable and would welcome the chance to help build backend systems that can scale to **300,000+ active agents**.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
**Christian J. Busca**
